# Non-fiction Book List

Why use GoodReads when I can pull an ‚ú® ultimate nerd ‚ú® and list my Non-Fiction reads in a repo?

Bear in mind, this is not an exhaustive list of recommendations.  In fact, I don't even know if they're good recommendations at all as they're based on my own interests and rabbit holes I've fallen down.  My greatest hope is that everyone find the 1-3 topics they just can't stop learning about.  If yours happen to align with mine, then may you find something of interest and curiosity here.

Also bear in mind that I am a serial book abandoner.  If it doesn't spark joy, odds are I will ditch it 60-120 pages in.  Doesn't mean it's a bad book per se, it just means it wasn't a right fit for where I was at.  I often pick abandoned reads back up weeks, months, or years later!

In general, I've tried to provide links to purchase these books from independent bookstores.  None of the links below are affiliate.  I get nothing from listing or reviewing any of them.  This is purely an exercise in my love of reading and learning and sharing that love of reading with the world!

All books follow an emoji-based labeling system as follows:
- üìñ reading or read a paper or e-book version
- üéßÔ∏è reading or read an audiobook version
- üëçÔ∏è recommend
- ‚≠êÔ∏è highly recommend
- ‚úñÔ∏è abandoned
- ‚è≠ want to read soon
- ‚úÖ completed

| [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=unknown&title=97+Things+Every+Programmer+Should+Know%3A+Collective+Wisdom+from+the+Experts+%282010-02-22%29&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚úÖ|This is an amazing series.  Little bite size chunks of knowledge that make the book easy to pick up at times when you have just a minute or two between other things.  Nice pieces to think on and discuss with others.  Just overall excellent little nuggets of wisdom.|

The descriptions of cloud infrastructure remained more surface-level and repetitive than I was hoping they'd be.  That one's on me as the title quite clearly explains it's a basic primer!|

| [Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Seife%2C+Charles&title=Zero%3A+The+Biography+of+a+Dangerous+Idea&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr) | ‚úÖ üìñ ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è| Yes, I double highly recommend.  I don't know exactly when I started becoming fascinated with the number zero, but it's just a seriously fun topic to ponder.  This book crossed of my history interests, my interests in the value of zero and infinity, and a number of other cool ideas along the way.  I was fascinated to really grasp how recent of an idea the number zero really is, at least in the way that it's accepted today!|
