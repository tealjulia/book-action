# Nonfiction Book List

Why use GoodReads when I can pull an ‚ú® ultimate nerd ‚ú® and list my Non-Fiction reads in a repo?

Bear in mind, this is not an exhaustive list of recommendations.  In fact, these are really based on my own interests and rabbit holes I've fallen down and some of them may not even be great recommendations.  My hope is that everyone finds that small handful topics they just can't stop learning about.  If yours happen to align with mine, then may you find something of interest and curiosity here.  I also currently have mostly male American authors on this reading list... I am aware and am hoping to seek out some more diverse voices on here in the near future.

Also bear in mind that I am a serial book abandoner.  If it doesn't spark joy, odds are I will ditch it 60-120 pages in.  Doesn't mean it's a bad book per se, it just means it wasn't a right fit for where I was at.  I often pick abandoned reads back up weeks, months, or years later.  I often just let them rot.

In general, I've tried to provide links to books on [bookfinder](https://www.bookfinder.com) as a fairly neutral source for finding a place to purchase your books from.  Some of these works are available (ethically) for free online as well.  In those cases, where known, I have linked directly to the book, such as [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).  But please check your local libraries as well!  I was able to read many of these books on [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) for free with my public library card.  I get nothing for listing any of these books.  None of the links below are affiliate.  This is purely me.  Broadcasting my love of reading to whomever will listen.

All books follow an emoji-based labeling system as follows:
- üìñ reading or read a paper or e-book version
- üéßÔ∏è reading or read an audiobook version
- üëçÔ∏è recommend
- ‚≠êÔ∏è highly recommend
- ‚úñÔ∏è abandoned
- ‚è≠ want to read soon
- ‚úÖ completed

Still made a valuable primer.|

The descriptions of cloud infrastructure remained more surface-level and repetitive than I was hoping they'd be.  That one's on me as the title quite clearly explains it's a basic primer!|

## Data
|Title|Labels|Notes|

|[97 Things Every Data Engineer Should Know](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Macey%2C+Tobias&title=97+Things+Every+Data+Engineer+Should+Know%3A+Collective+Wisdom+from+the+Experts&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ ‚úÖ ‚≠êÔ∏è|Really similar review to "97 Things Every Programmer Should Know".  Enjoyable, small, digestible pieces that lead to great conversations.  I did this as part of a book study and the articles really served as a nice jumping off place to discussing the persona of a data engineer.  This is a great series by O'Reilly Guides|
|[Data Pipelines Pocket Reference](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Densmore%2C+James&title=Data+Pipelines+Pocket+Reference%3A+Moving+and+Processing+Data+for+Analytics&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ ‚úÖ üëç|Started this one with some background knowledge in Reverse ETL looking to explore other pieces of the data pipeline and that's exactly what I'm getting so far. The example workflows outlined are easy to follow. |

Little bite size chunks of knowledge that make the book easy to pick up at times when you have just a minute or two between other things.  Nice pieces to think on and discuss with others.  Just overall excellent little nuggets of wisdom.|
|[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software 2nd Edition](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?isbn=9780137909100&st=xl&ac=qr)||Saw this in a few Twitter threads and picked up the Kindle sample.  Will be reading the rest as soon as I clear off a few "in progress" reads!|
|[Clean Code](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=author+not+set&title=Clean+Code%3A+a+Handbook+of+Agile+Software+Craftsmanship&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ|It may have just not be the right step in my journey when I picked this up.  I did glean some good ideas and pick up some standard industry knowledge, it just wasn't my favorite read for a handful of reasons.  I feel like I broke some unwritten law by writing that. Don't @ me.|
|[Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=David+Epstein&title=Range%3A+Why+Generalists+Triumph+in+a+Specialized+World&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|||

The topics make great pieces for team conversation as well.  I'm actually re-reading this one in 2022 for an engineering book club! üí•|

|[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Raymond%2C+Eric+S.&title=The+Cathedral&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr )|üìñ ‚úÖ ‚≠êÔ∏è|A fun look into the history of Linux and Open Source.  Quick read!|

I liked listening along with the narrative. This one checked a lot of boxes for me -- contemporary US history (especially the 70s) _and_ some nerdy awesomeness?  Yes please!  I loved the insight into what challenges they faced and how they worked them out.|
|[Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=author+not+set&title=Zero+to+One%3A+Notes+on+Startups%2C+Or+How+to+Build+the+Future&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üéßÔ∏è ‚úÖ üëçÔ∏è|My favorite was the delve into the startup bubble in the early 2000s as I lived through that from a much younger person's perspective (a kid with a dad in startups).  It was fun to see what was actually going on behind the rollercoaster (and crash) and what we can learn from it and how it informs or can inform practices today.  I enjoyed getting at least one person's perspective on the "startup headspace", especially since this is a book I see referenced a lot in Twitter threads.|


## Language-Specific
| Title | Labels | Notes |

|[Effective TypeScript](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Vanderkam%2C+Dan&title=Effective+TypeScript%3A+62+Specific+Ways+to+Improve+Your+TypeScript&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ||
|[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)|üìñ ‚úÖ ‚≠êÔ∏è|Bought it for the beautiful peacock on the cover, stayed for the fun deep dive into JavaScript.  I read this around when I was also in a coding bootcamp using JavaScript and it really helped reviewing and expanding on some fundamentals.  Also, the e-book is available **free** in the link to the left.|
|[Python Crash Course](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?ac=sl&st=sl&ref=bf_s2_a1_t1_1&qi=Hcxj5rrR1nwH8800P9Gx4LkY3yk_1497963026_1:105:180&bq=author%3Deric%2520matthes%26title%3Dpython%2520crash%2520course)|üìñ ‚úÖ ‚≠êÔ∏è|Fun book.  Enjoyed working through it.  This was my first introduction to a language outside of the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem aside from reading some samples in Java and C# online.  I enjoyed in and found it super fun to begin to connect the dots on "these are some of the fundamental things languages can and should be able to do and here's the tradeoffs of implementing them differently".|
|[React Hooks in Action](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Larsen%2C+John&title=React+Hooks+in+Action%3A+With+Suspense+and+Concurrent+Mode&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ‚úÖüëç|Nice explanation of some common patterns with React hooks.  The code examples were somewhat lengthy for my taste, but probably helpful.|
|[Testing JavaScript Applications](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Lucas+da+Costa&title=Testing+JavaScript+Applications&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ ‚úÖ| To be quite honest, I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or not!  It gave some great overview of different levels of testing, their purpose, and a high level comparison of types of tooling for browser automation (I was focusing on the E2E UI testing section).  However, the author really only went into detail about their preferred tools which was unfortunate. For sure worth a good skim for some context at the least!|


## Mathematics / Generally Nerdy Things

|[The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=author+not+set&title=The+Simpsons+and+Their+Mathematical+Secrets&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr)|üìñ üëç|I think my favorite genre is just "nerds doing things they're excited about".  This is great.|
| [Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=Seife%2C+Charles&title=Zero%3A+The+Biography+of+a+Dangerous+Idea&lang=en&st=xl&ac=qr) | ‚úÖ üìñ ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è| Yes, I double highly recommend.  I don't know exactly when I started becoming fascinated with the number zero, but it's just a seriously fun topic to ponder.  This book crossed of my history interests, my interests in the value of zero and infinity, and a number of other cool ideas along the way.  I was fascinated to really grasp how recent of an idea the number zero really is, at least in the way that it's accepted today!|
