# Non-fiction Book List

Why use GoodReads when I can pull an ✨ ultimate nerd ✨ and list my Non-Fiction reads in a repo?

Bear in mind, this is not an exhaustive list of recommendations and is based on my own interests and rabbit holes I've fallen down.  My greatest hope is that everyone find the 1-3 topics they just can't stop learning about.  

Also bear in mind that I am a serial book abandoner.  If it doesn't spark joy, odds are I will ditch it 60-120 pages in.  Doesn't mean it's a bad book per se, it just means it wasn't a right fit for where I was at.  I often pick abandoned reads back up weeks, months, or years later!

In general, I've tried to provide links to purchase these books from independent bookstores.  None of the links below are affiliate.  I get nothing from listing or reviewing any of them.  This is purely an exercise in my love of reading and learning and sharing that love of reading with the world!

All books follow an emoji-based labeling system as follows:
- 📖 currently reading / read
- 🎧️ currently listening / listened
- 👍️ recommend
- ⭐️ highly recommend
- ✖️ abandoned
- ⏭ want to read soon
- ✅ completed
